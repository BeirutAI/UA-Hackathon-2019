# Fleet Management Solution

Sharing bicycles represent a healthier and environment-friendly lifestyle, and there could be some interesting mechanism behind it! This dataset represents a history of usage of city bikes in San Francisco Area from 2017 until 2019. The goal is to explore and analyse this dataset in order to create a fleet management solution.

## Inspiration
Where do Bikeshare riders go? When do they ride? How far do they go? Which stations are most popular? What days of the week are most rides taken on?
